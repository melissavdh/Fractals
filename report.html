<h1><u>Scene Assignment (Fractals)</h1></u>

<p>The aim of this program is to display different fractals based on the user's
 choice.  The user is able to easily navigate around the generated images using
 the mouse.
</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>When the program is run, a popup box with instructions is displayed, from 
which the user selects a fractal to display.  
</p>

<p>If the user zooms in too far the fractal may lose resolution because of the 
limitations of using doubles.  When zooming in on particularly detailed areas 
the program may also slow down slightly.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The program is reasonably small and only requires three components, which we 
have called Fractal, MainWindow and Scene.  We designed Fractal independently 
of the other two (GUI) classes so that the maths could be tested prior to 
worrying about graphics.</p>

<p><b>Fractal</b> deals with the maths of the program and choosing the colour
of each pixel accordingly.</p>

<p><b>MainWindow</b> plots the images on screen, using data from Fractal. It 
also deals with listening for mouse clicks and key presses, and creating the 
popup box when necessary.</p>

<p><b>Scene</b> creates the main window, and initialises the program.</p>

<p>The fractal is plotted by iterating the absolute value of a point on the 
complex plane, up to an iteration limit.  If the absolute value remains below 2, 
then the point is within the set of the chosen fractal and is black.  Otherwise
it is coloured by how many iterations were applied before the absolute value 
reached the limit. The colouring of all the points displays the fractal.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The program is written in Java, and is implemented as three classes, Fractal
 containing 2 methods (plus testing methods), MainWindow containing 4 methods 
 and Scene containing 2 methods.  

<p>In Scene the <code>makeGUI</code> method creates a JFrame, and a MainWindow 
object to store the BufferedImage in.  The <code>main</code> method calls
 <code>makeGUI</code> to run the program.</p>
 
<p>In MainWindow, the constructor creates mouse and key listeners to listen 
for new events, and call <code>draw</code> accordingly. The 
<code>draw</code> method converts screen co-ordinates to fractal co-ordinates,
gets the colours from the <code>iterate</code> method in the Fractal class and
sets every pixel to its corresponding colour.  The <code>popup</code> method 
creates the popup menu for the user to choose fractals and to display 
instructions on how to use the program.  <code>getPreferredSize</code> is a 
method to set the size of the window that displays the fractal, whilst the 
<code>paintComponent</code> method from JPanel is overridden to enable custom 
graphics drawing using a BufferedImage.</p>

<p>Fractal contains an array or colours, with each colour corresponding to a 
specific number of iterations applied to a point. The array is filled and 
colours are chosen in the <code>colorize</code> method, using the HSB colour 
model. The <code>iterate</code> method iterates a formula (depending on the 
fractal chosen) on a point to determine its colour. </p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>The two graphical classes had to be manually tested to check for and 
eliminate bugs. However, since the Fractal class was written first, a few basic 
internal tests for the Mandelbrot set were included, so it could be checked
without the other classes.  These test simply iterated a specific point known 
to be within the set, and checked that the colour returned was black.</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>For the interest of the user, the iterative formulae used for the different 
types of fractals are shown below.  Note that the "Fish" fractal was discovered 
by accident following a bug in the code, but we decided its unique shape made it
worthwhile to keep.

<li><i>Mandelbrot: z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c
<li>Quartic Mandelbrot: z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>4</sup> + c
<li>Mandelbar: z<sub>n+1</sub> = (z*)<sup>2</sup> + c
<li>Quartic Mandelbar: z<sub>n+1</sub> = (z*)<sup>4</sup> + c
<li>Julia: z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c
